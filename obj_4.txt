-----Installing Mongodb -----
Install mongo on your linux machine as ::
sudo apt-get install mongodb mobgodb-server

enter password if prompted.

then simply type 
sudo service mongodb start

if it throws some error to make a directory /db/data or so,
simply make a dir as 
sudo mkdir /db
sudo mkdir /db/data

change permissions to 777 as 
sudo chmod -R 777 /db

now try starting mongodb with the same command as
sudo service mongodb start  
	or
simply type 
mongod
and press enter

mongodb should be start and running up

----creating a database----
go to terminal after having mongodb running up
type mongo and press enter

you will get a screen like following
MongoDB shell version: 2.6.10
connecting to: test
> 

to see already exisiting dbs, type 
show dbs
press enter

to make a db, simply enter following(eg db name is test)
use test

now test db is selected.
you can use various commands to insert, view, update contents of this db, with various collections.


----Creating a client on php to connect to mongodb ---

copy the following code and save it in a php file, and host it on localhost server(eg : apache2)

<?php
   // connect to mongodb
   $m = new MongoClient();
	
   echo "Connection to database successfully";
   // select a database
   $db = $m->test;
   echo "Database test selected";
?>

-- creating a collection --- 
<?php
   // connect to mongodb
   $m = new MongoClient();
   echo "Connection to database successfully";
	
   // select a database
   $db = $m->test;
   echo "Database test selected";
   $collection = $db->createCollection("test_collection");
   echo "Collection created succsessfully";
?>
